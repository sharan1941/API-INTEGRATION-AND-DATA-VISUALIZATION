DESCRIPTION

This project was developed as part of an internship task focusing on API integration and data visualization using Python. The main goal was to retrieve real-time weather forecast data from a public API and display it through meaningful visual representations. To achieve this, the OpenWeatherMap API was selected for its ease of use, free access to forecast data, and comprehensive documentation. The project involved writing a Python script that fetches 5-day weather forecast data for a specific city (in this case, Hyderabad) and visualizes the results using charts. The entire development and execution process was carried out using Visual Studio Code, which served as the IntegratedDevelopment Environment (IDE). This tool provided a suitable platform to manage Python scripts, install necessary libraries, and execute the program via the integrated terminal.

The task was divided into two major components: API integration and data visualization. API integration was handled using the requests library in Python, which allowed sending HTTP GET requests to the OpenWeatherMap API endpoint. The API response, in JSON format, contained forecast data for every three-hour interval over five days. Key weather parameters such as temperature and humidity were extracted from this JSON structure using standardPython parsing techniques. Error-handling mechanisms were also incorporated to ensure that the script could detect invalid API keys or handle failed requests gracefully.

After retrieving and parsing the data, the second part of the project focused on visualizing this information. The matplotlib library was used to create line charts that display changes in temperature and humidity over time. To meet the requirement of a "dashboard," the script was designed to show both charts in a single window using subplots. This allowed the user to observe temperature and humidity trends side-by-side for easy comparison. Dates and times were properly formatted on the x-axis usingPythonâ€™s datetime module to make the graphs more readable. Additional features such as legends, axis labels, titles, and grid lines were added to enhance clarity and professionalism.

The output of the project is a functional weather dashboard that visually represents forecast data in a way that is easy to interpret and insightful for users. Both temperature and humidity trends are plotted against time, providing a clear picture of weather patterns over the next five days. The charts update dynamically each time the script is run, pulling fresh data from the OpenWeatherMap API.

Overall, this project demonstrates essential skills in API integration, JSON parsing, anddata visualization using Python. It showcases the ability to work with external data sources, process real-time information, and present it in a user-friendly format. The use of open-source tools like OpenWeatherMap, requests, and matplotlib ensures that the project remains lightweight and cost-effective while still being powerful and educational. The task was completed successfully according to the given instructions, and the resulting dashboard meets all the stated requirements. It serves as a practical example of how real-world data can be transformed into meaningful insights through code.
